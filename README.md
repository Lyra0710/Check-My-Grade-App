### My Learning for Unit Testing:
- Learning about the unittest module. 
- Creating a test class. Here I created BasicTests class. 
- The test methods should start with a `test_`. 
- We write the code that will show the expected result, then compare it with the actual result using `assertion methods`. # Check-My-Grade-App
